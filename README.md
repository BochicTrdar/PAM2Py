TOL calculations might differ from PAMGuide below 5% and above 95% due to the difference in the calculation of percentiles between Matlab and Numpy. 

Min and max values in color figures can be changed interactively using the icons displayed at the top of the figure window. 

Missing package? Use pip or Anaconda-navigator to install it. 

Some matplotlib versions can crash when saving figures to PNG. The solution? Update matplotlib.
